            <p style="margin-left:55%; margin-top:-28%;color:brown;font-size: 20px;">Kasaragod boasts of the largest and best preserved Fort in the whole of Kerala, bordered by a magnificent beach. Shaped like a giant keyhole, the historic Bekal Fort was built in the 17th century. This historic monument offers a superb view of the Arabian Sea from its tall observation towers, which were occupied by gigantic cannons till afew centuries ago.

                Near the Fort is an old Mosque that is said to have been built by Tipu Sultan of Mysore. Originally constructed by the rulers of the ancient Kadampa Dynasty, the Fort changed hands over the years to the Kolathiri Rajas, the Vijayanagara Empire, Tipu Sultan and finally, the British East India Company.
                
                Today, the Bekal Fort and its scenic surroundings are fast becoming an international tourist destination and a favourite shooting locale for film makers.The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.

                An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan.[1] Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad,</p>
                <p style="color:brown;font-size: 20px;"> Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.
                
                The fort's zigzag entrance and surrounding trenches reveal its defensive strategy. Holes on the outer walls are designed to defend the fort effectively from naval attacks. The upper holes meant for aiming at the farthest targets; lower holes below for striking as enemy nearer and the lowest holes to attacking enemy closest to the fort</p>
